				The <b>LostData</b> project is everything in one. It is a sketch pad, an adventure, a blog, a database, a learning space, a dream catcher, and everything in between. 
				<b>LostData</b> is the systems door that I religiously open when I arrive in the office at 5:30am every morning, when crickets are deep asleep and all is quiet.
				In that moment of tranquility, I connect with data, analyse and brew more coffee. I discover stories hidden inside rows of data. I see emotion and interactivity bubble in records of resilient people in 
				Galgaduud, in Lower Shabelle and many diverse places that our beneficiaries call home. At noon, I create Tableau Dashboards, Story points and gnaw at my groundnuts.
				<p>
				Between meetings, when I am not hunting in the cloud for open data and painting dashboards, I rant, roll on the ground, peddle my feet in the air, and rant more about data. 
				Is there a personal connection in data? Can I relate that connection to create a dialogue? How do i create such a dialogue? How do I find pieces that I will need to build a story of change and resilience on?
				What is the story?
